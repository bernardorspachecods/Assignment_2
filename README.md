# Homework 2: Pandas!
## Introduction
The purpose of this exercise is to assess your understanding of Pandas
DataFrames and your ability to work with them effectively. You will implement
a series of functions that perform data manipulation tasks, including
cleaning, merging, and analyzing DataFrames.

## Submission Guidelines:
1. This is an assignment to be done in pairs of exactly 2 students, single
submission shall be penalized by 20%. Students who are caught cheating
will obtain a score of 0 points. This homework is worth 20% of your final
grade.
2. Comment your code properly, which includes naming your variables in a
meaningful manner. Badly documented code will be penalized.
3. There is a 25% penalty for deliveries at most 2 days late. Homeworks
submitted after this will be graded with 0 points.
4. Submit a single zipped folder following the naming convention
student1id_student2id.zip containing the 20 individual .py functions,
which are produced during the execution of the assignment.ipynb
notebook when running it from start to finish. Make sure that all of them
are inside the zipped folder. No additional files should be present, and the
submission must be in .zip format — other compression formats such as
.tar are not accepted.
5. The submission deadline is Tuesday, 21st of October 2025, at 23:59.
6. One group member shall submit the .zip file to the corresponding Moodle
activity. It is not necessary for both group members to submit.

## Setup
Beforeyoubegin,ensurethatyouanswereveryquestionintheassignment.ipynb
notebook. You must keep all provided function names unchanged and make
sure your outputs match the requested formats; otherwise, your answer to that
question will not be considered.
Your task is to implement the required functions in the assignment.ipynb
notebook. Read the instructions carefully and follow all specified requirements
and restrictions.

## Restrictions
You are not allowed to use third-party libraries. Only use libraries that are part
of the Python standard library (i.e. that do not require a pip install or conda
install).

## Files Provided
You are given 5 files:
1. assignment.ipynb – Contains the assignment instructions and exercises
to be completed.
2. onlineretail.csv – Dataset used for Part I and Part II of the assign-
ment.
3. customer_info.csv – Dataset also used for Part II of the assignment.
4. Managers.csv – Dataset used for Part III of the assignment.
5. Teams.csv – Dataset also used for Part III of the assignment.
